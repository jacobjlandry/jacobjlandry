Greetings Earthlings,

My name is Jacob. I'm a software engineer that mostly specializes in BPR apps written in PHP (mostly Laravel, these days). I'm currently using small hobby projects to enhance my Python, Java, C++, and Swift skills, as those have begun to lack significantly with my focus in PHP.
